# WWDC22 CoreMediaIO
## Sample Code for the WWDC22 Session "Create camera extension with Core Media IO"

This project attempts to replicate the sample code in the WWDC22 Session  10022: [Create camera extensions with Core Media I/O](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10022/)

More information can be found here: [Creating a camera extension with Core Media I/O](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremediaio/creating_a_camera_extension_with_core_media_i_o)

## The current problem

When I start the app from the Applications folder on macOS 12.4 "Monterey", I get the error: `request failed: Error Domain=OSSystemExtensionErrorDomain Code=9 "(null)"`

Any idea why would be appreciated.
